martinelli pdf! use some of that information
-> alignment is a minimizing problem (chi2) thats why i looked at chi2 plots

-> global translation and sheering motion don't change chi2 values because residuals are unchanged.

-> weak modes: presence of weak modes affect the convergence (poor, takes many iterations), bias in track parameters.

-> most visible weak modes is the "curvature bias" (sophie has mentioned it sometime. must be on one of my sheets)
also look at twiki!

goals:
source for now: DPG2021 pdf exact source will be included!
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item find the best possible configuration of alignables, degrees of freedom, constraints
%   \item check for weak modes (how? chi2, small eigenvalues)
%   \item null tests as good as possible
%   \item misalignment tests to check alignment
% \end{enumerate}

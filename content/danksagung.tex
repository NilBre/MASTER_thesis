\chapter*{Danksagung}

At this point i want to thank everyone who supported me during my time working
on the master thesis.

I would like to say a huge thank you to Professor Spaan for allowing me to write my master's thesis at his department and i am sorry that he had to leave us despite his young age.
i will be forever grateful for the inspirations and opportunities he has given me.
At the same time, I would like to thank Professor Albrecht for standing in for Mr. Spaan and accompanying me the rest of the way.

I would also like to thank Dr. Weingarten for second-guessing my thesis.

Special thanks go to my supervisor Sophie Hollitt who taught me a lot about Alignment and the SciFi in general. Through her, I met many new colleagues and quickly found my way into the collaboration.
I want to thank you for the extensive help with problems of any kind as well as for sacrificing your precious time for proofreading my thesis.
Thank you very much.

I also want to thank Lukas Calefice, Miroslav Saur and Dominik Neise for proofreading my work and Nicole Schulte and Fabian Koch for the moral support.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and close friends for supporting and motivating me throughout my journey. Without you i would be where i am right now.

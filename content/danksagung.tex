\chapter*{Danksagung}

At this point i want to thank everyone who supported me during my time working
on my master thesis.

I would like to say a huge thank you to Professor Spaan for allowing me to write my master's thesis at his department. At the same time, I would like to thank Professor Albrecht for standing in for Mr. Spaan and accompanying me the rest of the way.

I would also like to thank Dr. Weingarten for second-guessing my thesis.

Special thanks go to my supervisor Sophie Hollitt who taught me a lot about alignment and supported me during my time. My deepest thanks.

Thanks also to Lukas Calefice, Miroslav Saur for proofreading my work and Nicole Schulte for her support.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and close friends for supporting and motivating me throughout my journey.

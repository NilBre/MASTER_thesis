The LHCb detector is receiving an upgrade that began in 2019 in the form of a long
shutdown of the LHC. The three track detectors behind the dipole magnets have been
replaced with a detector that uses scintillating fibers (SciFi).
This is only part of the upgrade. Due to larger luminosities and the
number of trace multiplicities, detectors with finer granularity are needed.
The calibration of the new detector to the software regarding
orientation and position is critical for the subsequent performance. This
process is called \textit{alignment}.
\\
In this work, the software \textit{alignment} of the SciFi tracker is studied.
By testing different parameter configurations a good alignment could be achieved.
So called \textit{misalignment} tests contributed to the to determine the quality
of the alignment. In addition, tests for the identification of weak modes were performed.
This drew attention to a bias within the clusters which has important influence
on the alignment.

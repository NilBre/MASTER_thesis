With this analysis there are still more open questions. The cluster bias which prevents the alignment from working correctly is currently being analysed and will require more testing.
The alignment using particles is an aspect of the alignment that was not mentioned until this point. What impact particles play during the alignment will therefore be analysed.
Also how particles will help the misalignment of the SciFi detector will be looked at in great detail.
The analysis of weak fashions requires much more attention. Knowing the correlation between alignment parameters is therefore a crucial factor in understanding biases in track parameters.

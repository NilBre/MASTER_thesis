\label{sec:story}

% I'd like you to think about the work you have been doing on the alignment and what things have been investigated and what conclusions you have made. You want to build the story one piece at a time, so I think it will start with testing some of the constraints from the null tests and going from there. With the type of work you have been doing, you will also have a much larger "future work" and "continuing work" section, I would put it before the conclusion. This will be discussing things like the way we discovered the cluster bias and the way that it is linked to the rotational degrees of freedom, etc. And it can outline the things you know about the way the real detector will be aligned starting very soon.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item testing some of the constraints from the null tests
%   \item future work: discovered cluster bias + link to rotational degrees of freedom
% \end{itemize}

% taking notes for now so i know what plots to use
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item started with null tests.
%   \item which constraint does what?
%   \item which degree of freedom moves what part of the scifi?
% \end{enumerate}
\section{general info}

Alignment using tracks and vertices regarding stations, layers and modules. Testing constraints for different degrees of freedom with the goal to find the "perfect" configuration of constraints and alignable degrees of freedoms.
The following pre-installed alignment conditions with the survey constraints being\\
\\
"FT : 0 0 0 0 0 0 : 1 1 1 0.0003 0.0003 0.0003”\\
"FT/T. : 0 0 0 0 0 0 : 1 1 1 0.0003 0.0003 0.0003”\\
"FT/T./Layer(X1|U|V|X2) : 0 0 0 0 0 0 : 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.0001 0.0001 0.0001”\\
"FT/.*Module. : 0 0 0 0 0 0 : 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.001 0.001 0.001"\\
"FT/.*Mat. : 0 0 0 0 0 0 : 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.1 0.1 0.1”\\
were used.

The string is the name of the element, the first set of six numbers are hardcoded parameters for each of the 3 translation degrees of freedom and 3 rotational degrees of freedom (Tx, Ty, Tz, Rx, Ry, Rz) and the second set of six parameters are the corresponding uncertainties.

The scale for the translations are $\si{\milli\metre}$ and the scale for the rotations being $\si{\radian}$. A survey uncertainty of $\num{0.0001}$ stands for $\SI{0.1}{\milli\radian}$.

The alignments have been performed with gaudisplititer.

During the Alignment, lagrange constraints can be utilized to minimize the
$\chi^2$ under the condition
\begin{equation}
  f(\alpha) = 0
\end{equation}
and adding the lagrange parameter $\lambda$ to get
\begin{equation}
  \Delta \chi^2 = \lambda f(\alpha)
\end{equation}\,.

Lagrange constraints are added to fix losely constrained degrees of freedom and can be used for any linear combination of movements.

\section{Nulltests and software tests}

As a starting point, Alignment v17r1 was used with 5000 events, magnet in upward position and \textit{GoodLongTracks}.
The \textit{GoodLongTracks} have the following cuts and parameters:
\begin{itemize}
  \item minimum $P_{\text{total}} = 5000$ (units? 5000 MeV?)
  \item maximum $P_{\text{total}} = 200 000$ (units? 200 000 MeV = 200 GeV?)
  \item minimum $p_T = 200$ (units?)
  \item maximum $\chi^2 = 5$
  \item track type should be categorized as "long" (what does that mean -> hits in every subdetector)
  \item maximum number of THoles? is 1
\end{itemize}

and for the later used \textit{HighMomentumTTracks} the cuts and parameters are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item minimum $P_{\text{total}} = 50000$ (units?)
  \item track type should be categorized as "Ttrack"
  \item maximum $\chi^2 = 5$
\end{itemize}

% Results: (sort under the right plots) \\
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Alignment with Rz (and Rx) takes lots of iterations to converge
%   \item increasing nEvents does not improve it \to weak mode?
% \end{itemize}

At first, a series of tests regarding different degrees of freedom and lagrange constraints is performed to find the optimal solution for the SciFi. This called Nulltests.

The real detector layers are all centered around the beampipe with no shifting in any direction and the goal is to align the layers in the software to mirror the real layers, therefore reduce the shifting as close to zero as possible.

As a baseline the configuration from Florian Reiss is used and improved.
In this part, the steps of testing different configurations is described and analysed.
%What is florians configuration?? -> lxplus, one of the first plots.
%Then describe the configuration i chose.
Figure \ref{fig:dofs} is used to demonstrate which degrees of freedeom can be used
to describe a point in the detector or a shift in coordinates.

Florian made a crucial change in the code in form of a bug fix which resulted
in the following configuration:

\begin{itemize}
  \item dofs: Tx and Rz
  \item constraints: unconstrained
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

  \caption{comparison of different configurations without rotational constraints in every station, magnet up and 1000 events. plotted is translation in x versus global z.}
  \label{fig:june_2}
\end{figure}

The measurement points are the mean of each layer, therefore the errorbars on Florians measurement are root-mean-square errors and come from the difference between the C-side and the A-side of the detector layer and is NOT the measurement uncertainty.
The green measurement used the following configuration:
\begin{itemize}
  \item here my config for the green plots -> see lxplus i guess
\end{itemize}
The constraints are selected because... (first of all look them up, then describe)
This measurement only used 1000 events and is only used as a guideline to what the actual distribution could look like.

  \caption{comparison of different configurations without rotational constraints in all stations, magnet up and 7000 events. plotted is x translation versus global z.}
  \label{fig:june_2_1}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:june_2_1} the same measurement is performed for 7000 events to get a better picture. In comparison to \ref{fig:june_2} an overall improvement in Florians configuration is visible and the layer-splitting is reduced but still prominent. The green measurement shows no direct improvement since the layers are already pretty close to zero in x-direction, where we want them.

The following measurements used 3000 events because the performance did not change much when using 5000 or even 7000 events. Also, the time the computer needed to finish an alignment run for 7000 events and 10 iterations was a lot longer than for 3000 events.

the figure in \ref{fig:june_4} shows that very strict Tx constraints make Tx look better but when comparing to Tz as we can see in figure \ref{fig:june_5}

  \caption{compare C-Side to A-Side for Translation in z direction. (look up exact constraints and dofs)}
  \label{fig:june_5}
\end{figure}
a clear layer separation is visible. Because of the many constraints that are
applied to T3, the RMS uncertainty in the other stations get worse.

  \label{fig:june_6}
\end{figure}

Looking at figure \ref{fig:june_6}, the last two layers in station 3 are
seperation from the first two regarding x-translation. Especially the last
station should be fixed around zero with the constraints added. The sum of
all translations should be zero with each individual layer movement being small.

This layer-separation problem will be looked at at a later stage.

%\subsection{july plots}
\subsection{rotational constraints}
The impact of rotational constraints is looked at now. Firstly, comparing
florians starting configuration versus the new one with added constraints.
The direct impact to the rotations are quite small but the translations
in z- and x-direction show a small improvement to the previous configuration
seen in figure \ref{fig:june_4}.

%   \label{fig:aug13_CA_new}
% \end{figure}

Now, we have a configuration\footnote{The always used configuration will be
always called "config5" in the labels} which is quite ok but has a lot more room for improvement but is nevertheless and better representation than the first draft from florian.
Therefore we will now compare further configuration drafts to the "config5" with the following constraints
\begin{itemize}
  \item constraint 1
  \item constraint 2
  \item constraint 3
  \item ...
\end{itemize}
and the dataset used is taken from the bookkeeping (what exactly?).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{plots/august_13/2019_c5_old_vs_withRz_MU.png}
  \caption{config5 versus config 5 with Rz constraint for rotational improvement.}
  \label{fig:withRz}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:withRz} config5 is plotted against itself but with and added constraint to Rz.
The change is the constraint: (fill constraint here).
The result is a small improvement in Rz of around $\SI{0.005}{\milli\radian}$ in every layer. $Rx$ is mostly unchanged and the small differences in $Tx$ are caused by a nudge in the plotting script so that the data points do not overlap. The rotation around $z$ is correlated to the $z$ translation therefore we see small changes in every layer as well.
It is noteworthy, that both X-layers in T2 in the x-translation plot have a quite large RMS uncertainty which means the A-side and the C-side in the X-layers are quite far apart but the mean is right around 0. That is expected since the constraint added only brings the mean of the layer to 0. In future analyses another constraint should be added to also keep the side themselves small.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{plots/august_13/combi5_layers_averaged.png}
  \caption{flo with full layer constraint versus config 5}
  \label{fig:floFullL_c5}
\end{figure}

In comparison to what florians configuration looks like against the new
proposed configuration the figure \ref{fig:floFullL_c5} can be looked at.
The alignment was performed for 10 iterations and the alignable degrees of
freedom are $\symup{Tx}, \symup{Tz}, \symup{Rx}, \symup{Rz}$. The alignable
elements are the stations and the framelayers.
The constraints used are: \\
\\
"station3 : FT/T3 : Tx Rz Rx Rz" \\
"backCframeT3 : FT/T3/Layer(V|X2) : Tx Tz" \\
"FT/T3X1UCSide : /dd/Structure/LHCb/AfterMagnetRegion/T/FT/T3/Layer(X1|U)/Quarter(0|2) : Tx Tz Rx Rz" \\
"FT/T3VX2CSide : /dd/Structure/LHCb/AfterMagnetRegion/T/FT/T3/Layer(V|X2)/Quarter(0|2) : Tx Tz Rx Rz" \\
"FT/T3X1UASide : /dd/Structure/LHCb/AfterMagnetRegion/T/FT/T3/Layer(X1|U)/Quarter(1|3) : Tx Tz Rx Rz" \\
"FT/T3VX2ASide : /dd/Structure/LHCb/AfterMagnetRegion/T/FT/T3/Layer(V|X2)/Quarter(1|3) : Tx Tz Rx Rz" \\
\\
The first constraint constraints the overall station 3 in $\symup{Tx}, \symup{Tz},
\symup{Rx}$ and $\symup{Rz}$. The second constraint restricts the total movement
of the last C-frame to be 0 but the individual movement can differ.
The last four constraints are C-frame constraints as well but for each halflayer in station 3.

It is good to see that the layer separation in $Rz$ is mostly fixed. But there is still an offset from 0 that is troublesome. This will most certainly have something to do with the clusterbias. Regarding Tx, we(I) have managed to bring down the x-translation to roughly 0 which is a good improvement for the null tests of Tx.

Translation constraints as well as rotation constraints are not the only constraints tested. There are also scaling- and shearing constraints that were tested but
resulted in no improvement therefore they are just mentioned.

\section{chi2 tests and weak modes}
In this section, $\chi^2$ are performed in order to study the "goodness" of the alignment since the better the $\chi^2$ after the alignment the better.
The second aspect i want to cover is the impact of potential weak modes also known as "correlated alignment parameters". There are several weak modes that could occur namely \textit{global translation}, \textit{shearing} and \textit{curvature bias}.
weak modes are unaffected by the $\chi^2$ since the residuals do not change.
The effect weak modes have on the alignment are biases regarding track parameters and late convergences.
There are different solutions that can be utilized to reduce the effect from weakmodes such as
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\textbf{using other configurations like magnet off or mass plots for off-axis events}$
  \item $\textbf{utilizing other survey data sets}$
  \item $\textbf{using kinematic and vertex constraints}$
\end{itemize}\,.

\section{impact of the cluster bias}

As mentioned earlier the clusterbias most certainly causes the shift in the rotation around z for each layer so it does not reach 0.
To test that a momentary fix was found and implemented. The workaround was to a add a scaling to the value ... (look in laptop) by $\num{0.95}$.

Figure \ref{fig:cbhack_on_off} shows the impact of the cluster bias
hack regarding the rotation around $z$.
% show that there is a visible difference between low and normal luminosity however the difference is not big enough to differentiate between the two phases during the ramp up and full run. therefore, for the upcoming analysis steps only the "normal/low" luminosity is taken into consideration.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{plots/jan_24_2022/compare_with_without_hack.png}
  \caption{because of the clusterbias hack the difference between a measurement with the hack we implemented active and without is shown.}
  \label{fig:cbhack_on_off}
\end{figure}

As we expected, the amount of rotation was reduced to about
$\SI{0.004}{\milli\radian}$ from the previous $\SI{0.01}{\milli\radian}$ which is more than a factor of 2 improvement. We also know, that the fix for the cluster bias will not be the only source for the shift and we need further analysis to find the other sources.

Now that we know, that the cluster bias can be taken care of we take a closer look at samples of different luminosities since the LHC will not be operated at the maximum luminosity from the start, there is also the ramp up phase where the luminosity will be lower so that is what will be discussed in the following part.

Since we want to know what the shifts in rotation and translation will look like when the cluster bias is fixed we will keep it active for the next studies.
Figure \ref{fig:lumi_low_normal_hack_on} shows the difference between a sample with ramp-up luminosity and a sample with the luminosity during the measurement phase.
We see, that the layer separation is much more prominent in station 1 and 3 for the higher luminosity sample but slightly better behaved in station 2 when looking at x-translation.
Regarding the z-rotation, the lower luminosity sample as slightly lower rotational shifts.
The difference is so minute that i can be safely disregarded. (not sure about that)

some physics plots where i compared low to normal luminosities
one folder is with clusterbias hack active the other one without hack active

one plot comparing 8 samples of 100mu translation misalignment -> no visible change

then showing the difference when removing constraints 
--> (the y axis is weird because every curve is practically 1.3062 and the change is round 
     about 1e-5)

the plot with the horizontal curves show the global difference in chi2 over dofs between low 
and normal lumi but with a better y axis. they are flat since the changes are so small

----------
i wanted to do physics plots comparing the first to the last iteration for some clusterbias hack 
samples i ran but the visible change was basically 0.

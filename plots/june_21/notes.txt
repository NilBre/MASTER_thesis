here i tested what would happen if i removed the rotation constraints.
only constrain Tx and Tz (no Rx and no Rz)
-> removing rotation constraint worked quite good
later: constraining Tx and Rz maybe compare that too

i also tested what would happen if i constrain all stations in comparison to
on T3.
-> T3 worked much better

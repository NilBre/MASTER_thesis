- 2020 data (left 6500 events, right 10000 events)
- constraints:
-> constrain station 3 in Tx Tz Rx Rz
-> constraint backlayer in station 3 in Tx Tz Rz
-> constrain C-Frames in last station in Tx Tz Rx Rz

used DOFs are either Tx Rz or Tx Tz Rx Rz (labels in figure)

-----------------------
deacreasing chi2 / dofs with higher number of tracks is expected

chi2 / dof should not spike, instead decrease with number of iterations

the extended files have a plot with 20 iterations for the red curve because it looked promising.

in the "chi2_iter_extended" figure, the spikey behavior after iteration 10 maybe due to a programming error, but maybe not. further investigations are needed.
#############################
same files used as in the chi2 plots with the same constraints.
The dofs used are in the file name as well as in the figure.

layer separation is still an issue. more visible than in the MinBias 2019
data sample that i used earlier this year
